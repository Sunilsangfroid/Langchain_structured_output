-Structured Output:  It refers to the practice of having language models return responses in a well-defined data format (for example, JSON), rather than free-format text. This makes the model output easier to parse and work with programmatically.

-Why do we need Structured output ?
  Data Extraction, API Building and Agents .

-LLMs output is textual means it is unstructured, so we can't integrate with Databases, APIs etc. So we required structured output.

-Ways to get Structured Output
A) OpenAI LLMs generally give the structured output(use with_structured_output function from langchain)
B) Others are give unstructured output (use output_parsers function from langchain)

-with_structured_output
when we do model invoke we have to call with with_structured_output function with data format.(3 ways)
i) Typed Dictionary
    It is a way to define a dictionary in python where you specify what keys and values should exist. It helps ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structures.

    -why use TypedDict?
    {It tells python what keys are required and what types of values they should have.}
    {It does not validate data at runtime(it just helps with type hints for better coding.)}

    (Types: Simple TypedDict, Annotated TypedDict, Literal, More complex->with pros and cons)
ii) Pydantic 
iii) Json_Schema
